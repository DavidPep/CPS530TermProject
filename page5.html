                            <p>We would rate the overall performance of the frameworks a 4.5/5. The implementation of the different frameworks has been quite difficult. In the beginning it was a huge learning curve, but over time it got easier and simpler to use. This principle mostly applied to using semantic ui. It was much harder to use flask. However, given these quandaries, It was extremely helpful that we already learned how to use javascript, css, and python in class. Comparatively, it was initially far easier to learn the individual languages than it was to use the frameworks. However, over time, we came to recognize that it would be far more difficult to have created the great looking login and sign up pages on the demo sight without using Semantic UI. It would have also been difficult to create the back end of the website that allows for people to create blog post and actual accounts on the demo site without using Flask.
In retrospect, we wouldnâ€™t have done anything different because it was an overwhelmingly positive experience. We do not regret the frameworks we chose.</p>
